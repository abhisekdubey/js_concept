# Q1. Diffrence between var, let and cost?

- \*var\* has function scope, _let_ has block scope and allows reassignment, and _const_ has block scope but does not allow reassignment.

* var, let, and const are used to declare variables, but they have some differences in terms of scope, hoisting, and mutability.

# var:

Variables declared with var are function-scoped, meaning they are limited to the function in which they are declared.
var declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope, so you can use the variable before it's declared.
var allows variable redeclaration within the same scope

- function exampleVar() {
  if (true) {
  var x = 10;
  }
  console.log(x); // Outputs 10, even though it's inside the if block
  }

# let:

Variables declared with let are block-scoped, meaning they are limited to the block (enclosed by curly braces) in which they are declared.
let declarations are not hoisted to the top of their scope, and you cannot use the variable before it's declared.
let does not allow redeclaration of the same variable within the same scope.

- function exampleLet() {
  if (true) {
  let y = 20;
  }
  // console.log(y); // Error: y is not defined, as it's outside the block scope
  }

# const:

Variables declared with const are also block-scoped.
const is used for constant values, and once assigned, their values cannot be reassigned or redeclared.
It's important to note that while the variable itself is immutable, the object or array it points to may still be mutable.

- function exampleConst() {
  const z = 30;
  // z = 40; // Error: Assignment to a constant variable
  // const z = 40; // Error: Identifier 'z' has already been declared
  }

# var: Variables declared with var are function-scoped or globally scoped, but not block-scoped. If you declare a variable using var inside a loop

- for example, and then later in the code, the variable will still be accessible, leading to potential issues.

* for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  // code here
  }
  console.log(i); // i is still accessible here

* This can lead to unintended consequences, as the variable is not confined to the block scope of the loop.

# let and const: With the introduction of ES6, let and const were introduced, both of which are block-scoped.

- This means that variables declared with let or const are only accessible within the block (e.g., within a loop or an if statement) where they are defined.

* for (let j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
  // code here
  }
  console.log(j); // Error: j is not defined

* Using let or const prevents unintended variable hoisting and maintains better control over the scope of the variable.

# Q2. Temporal dead zone (TDZ)

- While inside the TDZ, the variable has not been initialized with a value, and any attempt to access it will result in a ReferenceError .

# Q3. Data Types

- primitive data types and one complex data type (non-primitive data types)

* \*\* Primitive Data Types:

1. String
   Represents textual data.
   Example: "Hello, World!"

2. Number
   Represents numeric data, including integers and floating-point numbers.
   Example: 42, 3.14

3. Boolean:
   Represents a logical entity and can have two values: true or false.

4. Undefined:
   Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
   Example: let x;

5. Null:
   Represents the absence of any object value.
   Example: let y = null;

6. Symbol (added in ECMAScript 6):
   Represents a unique identifier.
   Example: const key = Symbol('unique');

- \*\*Complex Data Type:

1.  Object:
    Represents a collection of key-value pairs (properties and methods).
    Example:

- let person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  isStudent: false
  };

2. Arrays:
   Arrays are a special kind of object used to store ordered collections of data.

- let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];

# Functions:

- Functions are a special type of object used for reusable code blocks.

* function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
  }
