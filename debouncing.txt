****Debouncing in JavaScript ***

Debouncing is a technique used to improve the performance and efficiency of certain functions that are triggered frequently, such as event handlers like scroll, resize, or input events. The goal of debouncing is to ensure that a function is only executed after a certain period of inactivity, reducing unnecessary and rapid executions.

The main idea behind debouncing is to set a timer that waits for a specified delay before executing the function. If the function is called again during this delay, the timer is reset. This way, the function will only be executed once the delay period has passed without any further calls.

- Debouncing is a programming practice used to ensure that time-consuming tasks do not fire so often, that it stalls the performance of the web page. In other words, it limits the rate at which a function gets invoked.

Debouncing in JavaScript is a practice used to improve browser performance. There might be some functionality in a web page that requires time-consuming computations. If such a method is invoked frequently, it might greatly affect the performance of the browser, as JavaScript is a single-threaded language.
